# üöÄ **Smart Home System by Codreanu Dan**

## üìù **Project Overview**

This is my bachelor's degree project, where I aimed to create a functional smart home system with a particular focus on the thermal control and air quality modules, using a variety of sensors for these tasks. I wanted to make my project as interactive as possible, so I designed it with a lot of visualization and diversity in mind.

## 1. üñ•Ô∏è **The Main Box Interface**

The main box, which contains the MCU, sensors, and actuators, is equipped with two screens: one LCD and one OLED. These screens display information such as:

- üì∂ Network connection status
- üìä Sensor data
- üå°Ô∏è Climate control information

</p>

**Navigation:**

- Navigation is done using a button.
- **Future Plans:** Add more buttons, cursors, and a larger screen with a fully developed menu.

## 2. üì° **Sensor Connectivity**

- **Sensor Communication:** All sensors are digital and communicate via the I2C protocol.
- **Air Quality Sensor:** Since the air quality sensor isn't compatible with the ESP32 microcontroller, it's connected to an Arduino Uno board that communicates with the ESP32 via UART.
- **Software Architecture:** Modular design incorporating elements from the FreeRTOS operating system.

## 3. üåê **IoT Server Communication**

Communication with the IoT server is done via Wi-Fi using the MQTT (Message Queuing Telemetry Transport) protocol.

- **Initial Connection:** The 'box' activates Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) to scan for a device and receive network credentials.
- **Mobile Phone Interaction:** Connect to the board using a mobile phone to transmit credentials. Once connected, data transfer occurs via Wi-Fi.
- **Future Plans:** Integrate the BLE feature into the mobile app and create a mechanism to store connection data from previous sessions.

## 4. ‚ùÑÔ∏è **Climate Control System**

For the climate control system, I used a Peltier cell, which operates based on the thermoelectric effect, to create a heating/cooling unit.

- **Control Mechanism:** The cell is controlled by an H-bridge that manages the current flow using two pairs of relays triggered by commands from a finite state machine for climate control.

## 5. ü§ñ **IoT Server and Raspberry Pi**

The Raspberry Pi hosts the IoT server, which includes the Mosquitto broker designed for the MQTT protocol.

- **Python Program:** A Python program runs on the server, acting as a client to control the data flow between the 'box,' Node-RED, and Firebase.
- **Server Program Structure:** The program is structured in classes to simplify usage. When running:
  - Receives data from the box and sends it to the Node-RED Dashboard, which then sends it to Firebase.
  - Receives data from the Node-RED Dashboard or mobile app via Firebase.
- **Main Tasks:** Establish the connection and handle received data, with synchronization through a JSON file.

## 6. üõ†Ô∏è **Node-RED and Firebase Integration**

- **Node-RED:** Used to create nodes between the server and the database, providing a visual programming interface for IoT projects.
- **Dashboard Creation:** Node-RED offers tools to create a Dashboard for accessing information and controlling the system.
- **Firebase:** A real-time database from Google chosen for its ease of use and performance, facilitating communication between the server and the mobile app.

## 7. üì± **Mobile App**

I created a simple Android app using Flutter. Currently, the app supports:

- üå°Ô∏è Climate control
- üìä Data visualization

**Future Plans:** Improve the app to make it more interactive.
